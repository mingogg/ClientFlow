This application (currently in development) is built using ShinyApp in R Programming and serves as a centralized hub for managing client information.

All data is stored in a single Excel sheet, enabling faster and easier access to critical client details.

Designed with efficiency AND speed in mind, it streamlines client follow-ups, simplifies data visualization, and minimizes the risk of accidental edits that can occur when multiple users share the same document.

Why This App Stands Out
What makes this app truly special is its keyboard-driven user experience (UX), which eliminates the need for a mouse entirely:

Enter: Quickly search for clients without lifting your hands from the keyboard.
F2: Instantly edit client information with a single key press.
F1: Save changes effortlessly while staying focused on your workflow.
Tab Navigation: Seamlessly move between fields in the editing panel, keeping your hands on the keyboard at all times.
This intuitive design ensures a smooth, efficient, and frustration-free experience, saving time and boosting productivity.
